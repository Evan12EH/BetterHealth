=============================
BetterHealth is a simple Android application that helps you easily track
your caloric intake throughout the day.


Installing and Running BetterHealth

directory for where you want the project to download at the bottom.

Click `Clone`

Open the project. If there is no configuration set when you first
open the app, continue with the instructions, otherwise there are
no more steps or downloads to make the application work.

Click the `Add Configuration...` button and then the
`Edit Configurations...` button.

Select `Android App` and name it "App" (or whatever you prefer).

Set the Module to `BetterHealth.app.main`

Press `Apply` and then `OK`

Finally, run the project. There are no other
steps or downloads to make the application work.

Features and Functionality
=============================
BetterHealth allows users to log foods and their calories into
the app, and then add those foods to your current day's progress
so the app can keep track of how many calories you've had.

When adding foods, you are allowed to add as many as you want, but
do note that the only way to look at all the foods you have added
is to scroll through text on a single page.

When resetting progress, the foods you have added to the app will
remain there, so if you wanted to completely empty your list, you
would need to individually delete every food you have made.
